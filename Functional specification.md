# Functional Specification

## I.Current Situation
Everyone, especially students, need to use a calculator everydady for whatever calculations they need to make, whether it's related to their classes or not.

We decided to make an online calculator that is very simple to use and provides basic calculation needs.
Acknowledging the need for some more advanced operations, we provided slightly more advanced operations (like the factorial..).

## II.Wanted System
Allowing users (especially students) to easily access and use the web based calculator and rapidly perform operations in a very simple way using a responsive layout and clear interface.

A simple yet appealing webpage where everything is visible.

A button (res) that displays the result of the operation is available.

An (AC) button to clear ongoing calculations and reset.

Available operations are multiplication, addition, division, substraction, factorial, square root.

## III.Current processes (model)
The user needs to make calculations
- They access the web page of the calculator:

- Starts entering numbers and performing operations.
- Calculations are continued.
- AC is hit to reset and start calculating again, or calculations are simply continued.
- Result is display.
- User Either continues calculating agian or quits the webpage when done.

## IV.Required processes (model)
- The calculator takes in numerical input from 0-9, as well as corresponding decimals and negatives.
- The user should be able to input an operation symbol from a list of operations that can be performed.
- The calculator must produce correct results in accordance with arithmetic rules
- In the event of an error, the calculator should be able to provide the user with sugestions such as:
    - "Cannot divide by zero".
    - "Square roots of negative numbers cannot be calculated".
- The calculator should contain a reset (CE) button to be able to restart the operation.

## V.Law, rules, standards
- The addition function will create a sum of the given numbers;
- The subtraction function will create a difference of the given numbers;
- The multiplication function will give a product of the given numbers;
- The division function will give the result of the division of given numbers;
- The factorial function will give the factorial of a given number
## VI.Requirement list
- Easy to navigate interface
- List of operations that can be performed
- Input sections
- Output section
- Variables to store input
- Operation buttons
- Functions to perform operatrions
- Style file to enable UI design
- "Clear All (CE)" button
- reason for operation failure section

## VII.Dictionary
- Sum-the result of the addition of multiple numbers;
- Difference-the result of the subtraction of multiple numbers;
- Product - the result of the multiplication of multiple numbers;
- Factorial - the product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g. factorial four ( 4! ) is equal to 24.

## VIII.Use case
- People can use our calculator to solve their daily problems. User could  use functions as multiplication, division, addition, substraction and factorial to achieve their goals.
